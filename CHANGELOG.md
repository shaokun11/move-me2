All notable changes to the `movement-v2` branch will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for precompiled contracts including ECRECOVER, SHA256, RIPEMD160, and IDENTITY, enabling direct use of these cryptographic functions within contracts.
- Support for EIP-1559 transaction types, introducing a more predictable gas fee structure and enhancing the user's experience by providing fee market changes.
- New functions such as `register_move_contract`, `call_evm_from_move`, etc., to facilitate interoperability between MOVE smart contracts and EVM smart contracts. This feature allows MOVE contracts to interact seamlessly with contracts deployed on the EVM, significantly broadening the capabilities and potential integrations within our ecosystem.
