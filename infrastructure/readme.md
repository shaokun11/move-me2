The Move Subnet infrastructure consists of the following components:

- **Bridge Faucet**: A web project that provides a user interface for operations between Move-VM and Move-EVM.

- **EVM-RPC**: A service that offers RPC capabilities for the Move Subnet. It can be used by projects in the EVM ecosystem, such as Metamask, ethers, and others.

- **Explorer**: An explorer specifically designed for the Move Subnet, allowing users to explore and navigate through its functionalities.

- **Subnet Proxy**: This component acts as a converter, transforming the Move Subnet's JSON-RPC service into a RESTful API format using the Aptos SDK. This enables developers to interact with the Move Subnet using RESTful endpoints.
